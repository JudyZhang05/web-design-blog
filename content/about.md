		<h3>Who am I, really?</h3>
		Also known as Judy. I don't have a nickname.
		It's quite hard to nickname someone who only has 4 characters in their name. But if you got one in mind please share it with the void.

		If you're still reading this, I admire your resolve to learn more about me. However, I am much more interesting in theory than in person. So please make do with that as you will.

		But since you seem eager to continue here are some things about myself:
		<h3>What drives me crazy?</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Unskippable ads, I have some complaints to whomever pitched this idea and would like to get compensated for my time.
			<li>Taxes -- Why. Need I say more?
			<li>Space, like everything to do with it, outerspace, personal space, the space on your keyboard, the space between the previous paragraph and the next. Wild stuff.
			<li>Spam, not the food kind, stop sending me emails about my car's extended warrenty.
			<li>Coding this website, it was hard, felt like a newborn deer trying to walk on it's own for the first time.
			<li>This list, I ran out of topics like three bullet points ago, I'll update this when I come up with more.
		</ul>
		<h3>Things I do to keep me sane...</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Drinking tea, specifically rose jasmine milk tea from Jooy, highly recommend.
			<li>Cats, need I say more?
			<li>Reading and watching shows/books and growing attached to fictional characters.
			<li>Rereading and rewatching shows/books and throwing myself at the wall for reopening a healing wound.
			<li>Therapy, the unprofessional kind. The cat kind.
		</ol>
