## Concept

We each started out this project by exploring the available API list while keeping track of the one's we found interesting. After looking at the collected list of API's we started brainstorming what we could do that satisfied the prompt of using API's in a "non-intended" way. We were rather enraptured by the quirky "Fun Translation API" which translated webpages and text into "Yoda-like-sentences". From there we built up the concept of having Baby Yoda be a tarot card reader, but instead of replicating a bon-fide tarot reading we were subsituting it with a random movie quote API. Baby yoda will translate the movie quotes into a yoda-like sentence and it will be conveyed as if it is a very compelling tarot reading. 

## Task Delegation

For this project, I will be handling the asset illustrations. Designing our tarot reader Baby Yoda while trying to convey this sort of dark mysterious aura that is typical for any tarot/palm readings. I will be paying a lot of attention to the visual graphics, using Adobe Illustrator and exporting them as Scalable Vector Graphics so the details are retained throughout the web. I will also be ensuring that the CSS motion animation works well with the rest of the page. After doing so, I will attend to some JavaScript manipualtions to ensure the right data is getting displayed in a manner that fits the mysterious yet funny Baby Yoda Tarot Reading vibe.
